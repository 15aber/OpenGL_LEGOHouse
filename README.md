### Animation and User Interaction
When the program starts the user is prompted for input by the console. To choose the height and start the building of the LEGO house the user must select a number between 1 and 6 (both included) on the keyboard. Once the height has been selected the building begins in the animation window. If a new height is selected the animation starts over to build a house with the new height.
